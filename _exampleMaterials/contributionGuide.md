# Comparisons, Nuance, and A Technique

While these example materials are quite helpful, they can also be misleading it not considered with care.
[Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)
notes that most academics suffer from [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome), and it can be all too easy to look at these materials and think "I have fewer publications than Person A and less teaching experience than Person B, I'll never get a job!" 
If we are not careful, we often compare ourselves to the best attributes of others. Continuing the example above, we may not notice that Person A did not spend time teaching and that Person B did not have as much service work. 
Application materials almost never include mistakes, failures or weaknesses: instead, you are an honest advocate for yourself and position yourself to the best advantage.
This is why Melanie Stefan's notion of a [CV of Failures](https://www.nature.com/articles/nj7322-467a) is so important. 
It can be tempting to look at these materials and imagine that the only safe route is to be the maximum of the union: "I'll just have to teach as many courses as [Hammad](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) and
have as many papers as [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) while being as interdisciplinary as [Madeline](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)". That is our anxiety; it is <i>not a viable plan</i>.
[Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)
may be a slightly biased in favor of his students and friends, but many (most?) of the example materials here resulted in top-tier outcomes in multiple areas,
from tenure-track offers at top-ten R1 schools (e.g., CMU)
to teaching-focused offers at top-ten R1 schools (e.g., Michigan)
to liberal-arts offers at top-twenty liberal arts colleges (e.g., Harvey Mudd)
to industrial research offers at top organizations (e.g., MIT Lincoln Labs). This is not a "random sample" of applicants or even an "indicative sample" of applicants.

You are strongly encouraged to consider <i>opportunity costs</i> when evaluating your outcomes. There is simply not enough time to do everything during
your graduate career. In addition, the benefit of a particular activity varies depending on the career you are seeking. For example, if you are 
looking for a teaching-focused position, at a certain point, serving as instructor of record in a course may be more useful than any number of
additional peer-reviewed publications. Conversely, if you are looking for an industrial research position, spending a summer on an internship or
demonstrating that your research can be deployed may be much more useful than teaching a class. And so on. 

In addition, you are strongly encouraged to consider <i>selectivity</i> when evaluating your outcomes. Leaving aside the (important) conversation
about whether rankings mean anything, whether rankings are moral or useful, etc., it is currently the case that instuations that perceive themselves
to be higher ranked (or to have a "big name" or a strong reputation) end up being more selective in terms of applicants&mdash;they will require more in each aspect before extending an offer.
[Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) notes that one way you can get a feeling for this, especially for academia, is to go to the websites of schools
you are considering, find some of their recently-hired faculty, download their CVs (or go to DBLP), and then <i>only consider the resume items and publications they
had by the year they were hired</i>. For example, you might look at recently-hired faculty at the University of Michigan and recently-hired faculty
at the Univeristy of New Mexico and use this technique to get a broad sense of what those schools end up expecting.  

[Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) notes that a higher-ranked school is <i>not</i> "better": instead, this is a technique for gaining more grounded
information about selectivity and mitigating imposter syndrome. As a concrete example, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Forrest">Stephanie Forrest</a> received R1 tenure-track offers from both the University of Michigan
and also the Univeristy of Arizona and accepted the offer at Arizona because it was a better fit for her context. [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) often recommends that applicants seeking academic jobs sit down (perhaps with their advisors) and determine that 
"on average, my record is comparable to people who are accepted at schools ranked XYZ", and then start, as a baseline, by applying to other
schools in a distirbution around XYZ, but also include some "safety schools" that may be less selective and some "aspirational schools"
that may be more selective, plus schools that are paritcularly interested in (e.g., are building a center in, have a history of strength in, etc.) 
an area that aligns with their expertise. 

This guide originally started as a more internal project with a smaller scope (e.g., writing down advice we would say to friends with certain
levels of prepration seeking certain types of jobs). It has grown to reach a wider audience, but some aspects of it (e.g., some of the older 
materials, some of the framing and writing) still have that old bias. 
[Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) recommends you not view these materials as a lower bound when considering
your own situation; instead, you should view them as upper bounds. 

# How to Contribute Materials

We are always looking for more application material profiles, especially for job-types or job-locations that are currently under-represented in our guide.

If you are interesting in contributing your materials, please fill out our contribution form available [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdLHwzuCsOcKHNBZBO9LGiWhVZPbcIE5-VpQ5hL8wQcFRAAMQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). This form includes places to upload PDFs of your materials, as well as add any information you'd like to better contextualize your application for readers. In this form, you can also indicate if you'd like to be kept anonymous. All materials are optional -- we greatly appreciate anything you'd be willing to share!
