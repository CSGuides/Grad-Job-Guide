# How to Contribute Materials

We are always looking for more application material profiles, especially for job-types or job-locations that are currently under-represented in our guide.

If you are interesting in contributing your materials, please fill out our contribution form available [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdLHwzuCsOcKHNBZBO9LGiWhVZPbcIE5-VpQ5hL8wQcFRAAMQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). This form includes places to upload PDFs of your materials, as well as add any information you'd like to better contextualize your application for readers. In this form, you can also indicate if you'd like to be kept anonymous. All materials are optional -- we greatly appreciate anything you'd be willing to share!

If you have any questions about contributing, please email Madeline Endres at <mendres@umass.edu>.
