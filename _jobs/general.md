# What Jobs Exist?

Despite the canonical "industry versus academia" phrasing, there are
actually many more options available. Below, we introduce several job
categories. *Note that this guide is written from a U.S. perspective, so 
these categories may not be as helpful for non-U.S. 
applicants.

- **U.S. Research Academia**: This includes "top-ten" schools like MIT,
  CMU, Berkeley, Stanford, and Cornell as well schools with lower rankings 
  like UC Irvine, Purdue, Rutgers, and Virginia. *Professors often consider 
  this the default type of application.* 

- **Industrial Research Labs**: This category includes Microsoft Research, IBM
  Research (T.J. Watson), Intel Labs, GrammaTech, Bell Labs, Sun Labs, NEC,
  BBN Raytheon, Google, and so on. We also include Federally Funded 
  Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) like Lincoln Labs and MITRE here.

- **Industrial "Startups"**: This includes Ph.D.-seeking high-tech
  companies or recently-formed startups. Examples
  include Coverity, Green Hills, Fortify and EMC. 
  We don’t have personal experience in this area, but others suggest
  that this work typically involves taking a research idea much further 
  than in academia, from concept to product, with all the steps along 
  the way (e.g., documentation, testing, shipping, marketing). Advice 
  we've received suggests that this can be very rewarding, and "right 
  out of school" is not a bad time to try it.

- **Non-U.S. U.S.-Like Research Academia**: This includes institutions like McGill, Toronto,
  Waterloo, and UBC in Canada; EPFL in Switzerland; University College London
  in the UK; and lesser-known places like
  John Cabot University in Italy. These schools operate similarly to U.S. 
  universities with respect to tenure and typically conduct classes in 
  English. However, U.S. applicants are sometimes not taken as 
  seriously, as they often decline job offers when given. 
  Apply to these positions only if you are serious about them, to avoid 
  making the process harder for others.
  <!--The trick here is that they tend not to take US applicants seriously. US
  applicants typically tend (for whatever reason -- picking the known over the
  unknown, staying close to family, trying to use such places as safety schools,
  etc.) not to accept jobs even when they are offered. You should only apply for 
  non-US positions if you're serious about them. You're making it harder for 
  everyone else otherwise.-->
	<details>
	<summary>Expand for more on applying to Non-US US-Like Research Academia</summary>
  <p>When applying to these institutions, it's important to convey
  why they should take your application seriously. We recommend including a few sentences in your cover letter and research
  statement explicitly stating why you really want to go there (e.g., you speak the local language, have family
  there, or are not tied to the U.S.). Also emphasize these points during 
  phone calls and interviews. For example, Claire's Francophone 
  background and fluency in French were relevant in Canada, even outside 
  Quebec.</p>
  
  <p>If granted an interview, familiarize yourself with the country's 
  basic political and geographical details (e.g., the name
  of the current prime minister, or all of the provinces of the country 
  in question). If you are offered a position, ask about immigration 
  assistance and support for you and your spouse (if applicable)..  
  The school will have experience with these issues and can be quite
  helpful.  It is also legitimate to ask about differences between 
  academic systems.  For example, salaries in Canada are 12-month, not 
  9; tenure is decided
  at 5 years, not 6; and the funding system is almost entirely different as
  compared to the States.</p>
  
  <p>One more word on applying to Canada: Computer Science (CS) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) departments are often 
  interchangeable for Software Engineering applicants. Apply to both, 
  but be aware that relationships between the two departments vary by 
  school. All schools will tell you that they
  get along capitally, especially as compared to all other schools, which are
  plagued by infighting and competition.</p></details>

- **Non-US Research Academia**: This includes institutions like ENS in
  France, Oxford in the UK and Tsinghua in China. These schools may not
  conduct classes in English, usually have different promotion and tenure
  schemes, and often have different requirements (e.g., post-docs, 
  second degrees). For example, in the UK, a post-doc is effectively 
  mandatory. Hiring is often localized, so if you’re not already 
  familiar a given institution or location, you may not want to count on 
  them as a job option.
   
- **Top-Tier Teaching Academia**: This includes places like Carleton,
  Williams, Wesleyan, Oberlin and Brown. Faculty here still conduct research
  but undergraduate education is emphasized, and the graduate program is smaller or non-existent. (As an aside, a
  <i>university</i> has a graduate program and a <i>college</i> does not.) 
  Teaching three or more courses per year is common. 

- **Teaching Academia**: This includes smaller liberal arts colleges 
  that may be less well-known outside their local areas, such as 
  Shippensburg, Lock Haven, Haverford, Juniata, and Ithaca College. Here 
  the emphasis will be on undergraduate education,
  undergraduate advising and scholarship (to the possible exclusion of the
  constantly-publishing-papers type of research). Teaching six courses a year
  is common, and salaries are generally around half of what you
  would receive from the Research Academia category. 

- **"Instructor" Positions**: Most top-tier schools, including Michigan
  and Virginia, have full-time teaching-focused positions.
  Job titles vary, including "Teaching Professor", "Instructor" or "Lecturer". 
  These positions may or may not be tenure-track (and often are not). 
  However, they often have a "social tenure" or "formal expectation of continued 
  employment" at around the six-year mark that mimics tenure. They tend to
  focus on teaching undergraduate "service" courses. 
  In such a position you typically have no
  research requirements but a high teaching requirement.
  <!--If you are interested in one, we recommend you reach out to
  the teaching-focused instructors faculty at your university.-->

- **Standard Industry**: If you want to get a job as a standard
  Developer, your Ph.D. certainly qualifies you. You don't need
  this document in that case. While grad students often aim for more 
  research-oriented roles, these positions are a solid option, 
  particularly if you face a two-body problem. A key advantage is the 
  work-life balance, with clear boundaries between work and personal 
  time.

- **Post-Docs**: Post-doc positions are still somewhat rare in Computer 
  Science, especially outside of CS Theory. However, they have become 
  more common in the U.S. due to the 2008 the financial crisis and 
  COVID-19; during and after both, many schools froze hiring. 
  The low job supply forced
  qualified candidates into post-doc roles. It then became more
  difficult for fresh PhDs to compete with such buffed CVs. That said, it is
  still possible (as of 2024) to acquire a tenure-track faculty position in Software Engineering or
  Systems without completing a post-doc first. 
  
  Taking a post-doc caq give you time to build your publication record. 
  In addition, post-docs can be helpful
  for non U.S. grad students who eventually want a full-time position in 
  the U.S. On the other hand, if you have taken a post-doc
  people will expect more publications. The general advice is to accept 
  a tenure-track job if you can get one without a post-doc.

**In this Guide, we focus on the jobs where we have the
most direct experience: US Research Academia, Industrial Research Labs,
Teaching Academia, and ``Instructor'' positions.**


Ultimately you must decide what sort of positions you will apply for based on your own interests and goals. <span class="highlight">A research position is not inherently "better" or "worse" than a
teaching position---they are made up of different things. Find out what
makes you happy. </span>


# When Should I Apply to Jobs?

If you plan to be interviewing for jobs in the spring of Year X, you 
must submit applications in the fall of Year X-1 (or by mid-January of 
Year X). Deciding where to apply early is crucial because different 
types of institutions have different deadlines.

- **Research Academia**:  The earliest deadline that we've seen for a Research 
  Academia position is November 15th, and most applications will be due in December or January.
  Job postings usually contain a deadline for when they will "start considering" applications.
  In practice, however, many positions will accept and review applications submitted 
  after this date. Thus, if you missed an application deadline by a few days or a week, 
  it may still be worth applying. 
  It is rare, but not unheard of, for a school to have a hard application
  deadline. For example, Madeline was unable to apply to UC Berkeley due to a missed
  deadline on December 1st. However, she also received a job offer for a school that she applied
  to two-weeks after the stated deadline. We recommend that you read through job postings
  carefully, and keep track of deadlines using a spreadsheet.

- **Industrial Research Labs**: Industry tends to feature "rolling
  interviews" (they aren't on Academia's semester clock) but they will do
  most of their interviewing for this type of position at the same time as
  academia will.  

- **Industrial "Startups"**: These also generally follow
  Industry's looser time clock.

- **Non-US US-Like Research Academia**: Like with US Research Academia, 
  your applications will typically be due in November, December, or January.

- **Non-US Research Academia**: These can vary widely, and may or may not
  align with the US semester clock.

- **Top-Tier Teaching Academia**: The interview schedule for
  such schools is typically one to two months ahead of the schedule for
  Research Academia (e.g., late September or October). Your application and letters of recommendation will be
  due weeks in advance as well. Thus if you plan on applying to such a school
  you must have all of your references ready early. 

- **Teaching Academia**: These often follow the same schedule as Top-Tier Teaching
  Academia.

- **"Instructor" Positions**: Depending on the school, these can follow the
  Research or Teaching Academia schedule.

- **Standard Industry**: These will have rolling deadlines, and positions will
  be posted throughout the year.

- **Post-Docs**: Post-doc positions typically use
  the same calendar as Research Academia, possibly offset slightly and with less
  strict deadlines (many people conduct a faculty search first before looking for
  a post-doc position).
