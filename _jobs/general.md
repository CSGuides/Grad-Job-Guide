# What Jobs Exist?

Despite the canonical "industry versus academia" phrasing, there are
actually a number of choices. We introduce several options below. We note
that this guide is written from a US perspective, so these categories may
or may not apply for non US applicants.

- **US Research Academia**: This includes "top-ten" schools like MIT,
  CMU, Berkeley, Stanford, and Cornell as well schools with lower rankings
  like UC Irvine, Purdue, Rutgers, and Virginia. Professors often consider 
  this the default type of application. 

- **Industrial Research Labs**: This includes Microsoft Research, IBM
  Research (T.J. Watson), Intel Labs, GrammaTech, Bell Labs, Sun Labs, NEC,
  BBN Raytheon, Google, and so on.  
  We group Federally Funded Research and Development Centers
  (FFRDCs) like Lincoln Labs and MITRE in this category. 

- **Industrial "Startups"**: This includes Ph.D.-seeking high-tech
  companies or recently-formed startups. Examples
  include Coverity, Green Hills, Fortify and EMC. 
  We have no personal experience with this type
  of work, but others suggest that it typically involves taking a research
  idea much further than you would in academia. Over the course of years you
  take a good idea from concept to product with all of the steps along the
  way (e.g., documentation, testing, shipping, marketing). Advice we've
  received suggests that this is actually very rewarding and that "right out
  of school" is not a bad time to try it. 

- **Non-US US-Like Research Academia**: This includes McGill, Toronto,
  Waterloo, and UBC in Canada; EPFL in Switzerland; University College London
  in the UK; and lesser-known places like
  John Cabot University in Italy.  These schools are located outside of the US
  but follow many US practices with respect to tenure and conduct
  classes in English. This is basically just like a job at a US university. 
  
  The trick here is that they tend not to take US applicants seriously. US
  applicants typically tend (for whatever reason -- picking the known over the
  unknown, staying close to family, trying to use such places as safety schools,
  etc.) not to accept jobs even when they are offered.  
  You should only apply for non-US positions if you're serious about them. 
  You're making it harder for everyone else otherwise.
  
  We recommend including a few sentences in your cover letter and research
  statement explicitly stating why you really want to go there and why
  they should take you seriously (e.g., you speak the local language, you have family
  there, you are not tied to the US, etc.).  You can also emphasize these
  facts on the phone and in person.  For example, Claire is of Francophone descent
  and speaks French fluently, facts that are relevant in Canada even outside
  Quebec.  If you are granted an interview, try to know (at a minimum) the name
  of the current prime minister and all of the provinces (states, departments,
  whatever) of the country in question.
  
  If you are offered an interview or a position at such an institution, ask about
  immigration and the kind of help they'll provide you and your spouse (if relevant).  
  The school will have experience with these issues and can be quite
  helpful.  It is also legitimate to ask about differences between academic
  systems.  For example, salaries in Canada are 12-month, not 9; tenure is decided
  at 5 years, not 6; and the funding system is almost entirely different as
  compared to the States.
  
  One more word on applying to Canada: Canadian CS and ECE departments are
  typically interchangeable for the purposes of an SE applicant, and thus you should apply
  to both.  Evidently there is considerable variation in terms of how well the two
  departments get along at different schools. All schools will tell you that they
  get along capitally, especially as compared to all other schools, which are
  plagued by infighting and competition.

- **Non-US Research Academia**: This includes places like ENS in
  France, Oxford in the UK and Tsinghua in China. These places may not
  conduct classes in English, usually have a different promotion and tenure
  scheme, and often have different requirements (e.g., they may expect a
  post-doc or a second degree and they are rumored to tend to hire "locally").
  We can't help you here, and in general if you don't already know much more
  about this corner of the world than we do you shouldn't count on ending up
  at one of these places.  The one piece of insight we can add is that in the UK
  in particular, a post-doc is effectively mandatory.

- **Top-Tier Teaching Academia**: This includes places like Carleton,
  Williams, Wesleyan, Oberlin and Brown. Faculty here still conduct research
  but undergraduate education is emphasized and the graduate program (and
  thus graduate students) will be smaller or non-existent. (As an aside, a
  <i>university</i> has a graduate program and a <i>college</i> does not.) 
  Teaching at least 3 courses per year is common. 

- **Teaching Academia**: This includes standard small liberal arts
  universities that you probably haven't heard of unless you're from the
  locale. Shippensburg, Lock Haven, Haverford, Juniata and Ithaca College are
  all good examples. Here the emphasis will be on undergraduate education,
  undergraduate advising and scholarship (to the possible exclusion of the
  constantly-publishing-papers type of research). Teaching 6 courses a year
  is common. In addition, the salary will probably be around half of what you
  would receive from the Research Academia category. 

- **"Instructor" Positions**: Most top-tier schools (Michigan and 
  Virginia are both examples) have full-time teaching-focused positions.
  Job titles vary from "Teaching Professor" to "Instructor" or "Lecturer". 
  These positions may or may not be tenure-track (and often are not). 
  However, they often have a "social tenure" or "formal expectation of continued 
  employment" at around the six-year mark that mimics tenure. They tend to
  focus on teaching undergraduate "service" courses (freeing up the research
  faculty to do other things). In such a position you typically have no
  research requirements but a high teaching requirement of CS100-ish classes.
  If you are interested in one, we recommend you reach out to
  the teaching-focused instructors faculty at your university.

- **Standard Industry**: If you want to get a job as a normal
  Microsoft Developer, your Ph.D. certainly qualifies you. You don't need
  this document in that case. Typically grad students aren't interested in
  standard dev jobs, but it might be handy to remember that they're out there
  if you're jousting with a two-body problem. There is something to be said
  for having your work "end" when you go home for the evening or the weekend.

- **Post-Docs**: Post-docs remain somewhat rare in Computer Science (at
  least in our neck of the woods, that is, Not Theory). Traditionally, European
  grad students apply for post-docs in the US and then apply for another job
  later.  They have become more common in the US since 2008, as a number of
  schools froze hiring post-financial crisis and during COVID-19.  The low job 
  supply forced otherwise
  qualified candidates to take post-docs and try again later.  It then became more
  difficult for fresh PhDs to compete with such buffed CVs. That said, it is
  still possible (as of 2024) to acquire a tenure-track faculty position in SE or
  Systems without completing a post-doc first.  
  Taking a post-doc gives you time to flesh out your resume
  with additional publications. On the other hand, if you have taken a post-doc
  people will expect your resume to be flush with publications. The typical advice
  is that if you can get a job without getting a post-doc, go for the
  job.

Having enumerated all of those possible options, we will now conveniently
forget all of them except research academia and industrial research labs.

Ultimately you must decide what sort of positions you will apply for on
your own. A research position is not inherently "better" or "worse" than a
teaching position -- they are made up of different things. Find out what
makes you happy. 

# When Should I Apply to Jobs?

If you plan to be doing your job search interviews in the Spring of Year X
you must submit applications in the Fall of Year X-1 (or by January 15-ish
of Year X). You must decide where you will be applying early because
different categories of institutions have different deadlines. 

- **Research Academia**:  The earliest deadline that we've seen for a Research 
  Academia position is November 15th, and most applications will be due in December or January.
  Job postings usually contain a deadline for when they will "start considering" applications.
  In practice, however, many positions will accept and review applications submitted 
  after this date. Thus, if you missed an application deadline by a few days or a week, 
  it may still be worth applying. 
  It is rare, but not unheard of, for a school to have a hard application
  deadline. For example, Madeline was unable to apply to UC Berkeley due to a missed
  deadline on December 1st. However, she also received a job offer for a school that she applied
  to two-weeks after the stated deadline. We recommend that you read through job postings
  carefully, and keep track of deadlines using a spreadsheet.

- **Industrial Research Labs**: Industry tends to feature "rolling
  interviews" (they aren't on Academia's semester clock) but they will do
  most of their interviewing for this type of position at the same time as
  academia will.  

- **Industrial "Startups"**: These also generally follow
  Industry's looser time clock.

- **Non-US US-Like Research Academia**: Like with US Research Academia, 
  your applications will typically be due in November, December, or January.

- **Non-US Research Academia**: These can vary widely, and may or may not
  align with the US semester clock.

- **Top-Tier Teaching Academia**: The interview schedule for
  such schools is typically one to two months ahead of the schedule for
  Research Academia (e.g., late September or October). Your application and letters of recommendation will be
  due weeks in advance as well. Thus if you plan on applying to such a school
  you must have all of your references ready early. 

- **Teaching Academia**: These often follow the same schedule as Top-Tier Teaching
  Academia.

- **"Instructor" Positions**: Depending on the school, these can follow the
  Research or Teaching Academia schedule.

- **Standard Industry**: These will have rolling deadlines, and positions will
  be posted throughout the year.

- **Post-Docs**: Post-doc positions typically use
  the same calendar as Research Academia, possibly offset slightly and with less
  strict deadlines (many people conduct a faculty search first before looking for
  a post-doc position).
