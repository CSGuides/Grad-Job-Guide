# Where To Apply In Particular

Now that you know the sorts of jobs you're looking for you still have to find
actual jobs to apply for. Here are some approaches:

- **Word of Mouth**: If you mention that you'll be on the job market,
  people at conferences will tell you if their department is hiring.  They may
  even offer to shepherd your application and make sure that it doesn't get lost
  (since you're at the same conference they probably like you and the sort of work
  you do, so this isn't all that uncommon). You can expect two or three of these
  from a big conference. They're not required, but can be extremely helpful.
  Claire gave two conference talks in the six months before applying for jobs and
  found this approach extremely useful.  She did not end those talks with "I am on
  the job market," but should have in hindsight.

- **ACM, CRA, and IEEE**: The ACM, CRA, and IEEE Higher Ed all keep
  databases of CS jobs that you can search through.  They have mailing lists that
  can send you daily or weekly postings of the most recent job ads.  The blurbs
  there can be hard to follow, and are not always consistent with either one
  another or what is posted on department websites.  We recommend that you get the
  names of places that are hiring from these databases and then go to the
  department websites (or whatnot) to double-check the details.

- **Rankings + Google**: Get a list of department rankings. The two most
  popular are from US News & World Report and the CRA Taulbee Survey. Go to the
  department website of every school in the top N and see if they are advertising
  an opening. Note that they probably won't have the advertisement up until the
  middle of the Fall Semester.  Claire took the top 100 schools on one such list
  and put them in a spreadsheet, with a separate section for Canadian schools.
  She updated the spreadsheet when a school on the list posted a job to one of the
  above-mentioned websites.  Before applying, she reviewed the schools that were
  hiring and filtered according to various preferences. She aimed to apply to
  approximately an equal number of schools ranked above and below her graduate
  institution (UVA).
  
  If you choose to take a similar approach, Claire recommends modifying your
  starting list and filtering criteria as appropriate.  Not everyone wants to work
  at a top-ranked school, so don't feel like "top 100" is the only way to go.  For
  example, Claire aimed to apply mostly to larger departments.  You are likely to
  have different preferences.
  
- **Ask Around**: Your advisor may forward job offers to you. Ask your
  recently-graduated friends if they know anyone who is hiring.

In 2005, Wes applied to 21 places and got 8 interviews and 5 job offers. In
2013, Claire applied to 28 schools and 1 research lab, got 10 invitations to
interview, went on 9 interviews, and received 8 offers.  Rumor has it that
getting interviews at 33% of your places is average and that the best person in
a particular field-year will get around 50%. A very strong candidate in Wes's
field-year (in his opinion the strongest candidate) applied to 30 places, got 17
interview offers, went on 15 interviews and got 7 job offers.

When considering these data points, note that Spring 2005 was considered to
have "strong competition" and "many strong applicants" in PL/SE (almost
everywhere Wes interviewed remarked on it).  Claire's current impression is that
2013 was a candidate's market: the hiring freeze post-financial crisis was
thawing, and the wave of candidates who had started postdocs in 2008 and applied
for faculty positions 2 or 3 years later had thinned.

If you are in a "non-standard" CS field like HCI the numbers are probably
completely different. If you are trying to solve the academic two-body problem
you should be applying to at least 40 places. Some couples do 60.

Claire was told by different people at different points in the year that the
number of positions to which she applied was (A) far too many, (B) far too few,
and (C) exactly right.  Make of that what you will.

Zak applied to 15 jobs, had interviews at five, and received two offers.
For industrial-specific positions, he has three pieces of advice.  First,
cast a wide net by asking everyone you can about places they know that have
hired people in the past.  The idea here is that industrial jobs are
somewhat less "searchable" than academic positions and
word-of-mouth often tends to be much more helpful when finding places to
apply.  Second, consider places that might not immediately seem like a fit.
It turns out that jobs in industry can be somewhat more fluid and that it
is often easy to find a fit once you start talking to people at a given
company.  It certainly cannot hurt you to consider a wide range of
companies initially and narrow the pool down once you start talking to
people at said companies and getting a better feel for the types of
positions they have to offer.  Finally, the schedule for industrial hiring
seemed very much more fluid than the somewhat rigid academic semester-based
timeline. Some of the companies I initially talked to eventually contacted
me about positions well into the summer of 2014, even after I had started
my eventual job. Different companies work on different hiring schedules
and there were several I was disappointed to find out simply weren't
hiring when I was looking for jobs.  I'd recommend starting the search
very early and contacting people at each potential employer to get an idea
for how often and when they tend to hire.
