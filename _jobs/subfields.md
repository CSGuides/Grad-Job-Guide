# Research Area and Where to Apply

All of the job postings you find in academia will use basically the same
boilerplate ad copy (e.g., "we encourage all qualified applicants from all
areas of computer science to apply, we are an equal-opportunity ...").
Beyond that, there are two ways the ads are typically formed: 

- One says "we are particularly looking for people in bioinformatics and
  datamining, ...", at which point you shouldn't get your hopes up unless
  you're in those areas. Here's a concrete example from Purdue's 2005
  search (emphasis ours):
  
  - The Department of Computer Sciences at Purdue University invites
    applications for tenure-track positions beginning August 2005. Positions
    are available at the Assistant Professor level; senior positions will be
    considered for highly qualified applicants. Applications from outstanding
    candidates in all areas of computer science will be considered. *Of
    particular interest are candidates in the areas of programming languages
    and compilers, software engineering, operating systems, data mining, and
    bioinformatics.*

- The other kind of ad says "our department has strengths in areas X, Y
  and Z and we are looking for people who can either augment or complement
  those strengths", at which point you really have no information since
  they've covered all of the bases. Here's a concrete example from Virginia's
  2005 search (emphasis mine): 
  
  - The University of Virginia ranks consistently as one of the top public
    universities in the country. Its highly valued Department of Computer
    Science has a diverse population with more than 300 undergraduate
    students, 110 graduate students, and 28 faculty members. The department
    offers baccalaureate, master, and doctoral degrees in Computer Science
    and Computer Engineering. The department is undergoing significant growth
    and programmatic evolution and aims to be one of the top departments in
    experimental systems research and the leading institution in
    undergraduate computer science education. *Its existing strengths include
    algorithms, architecture, compilers, distributed systems, graphics, grid
    computing, mobile computing, networks, operating systems, programming
    environments, real-time and embedded systems, security, sensor networks,
    and software engineering.* 

If your work spans more than one subfield, carefully consider the way you
position yourself and your work.  Departments have areas in mind when they
interview and assign applications to faculty in specific areas for
batch-processing.  Claire's publication record was, as of 2012/2013, fairly
evenly split between evolutionary computation and software engineering venues.
However, she considers herself primarily an SE researcher, and wanted to be
considered as such as an applicant.  She thus pitched herself as an "SE person"
who borrows insights from other fields (evolutionary computation/GP) as opposed
to a person who floats in the void between research areas.

One notable exception to the "apply largely to schools specifically hiring in
your area" rule is the class of "top 1" schools.  CMU CS, for example, is huge,
and its school of computing has multiple departments.  Thus, its job ad is
typically very general in its call, and applications are routed based on area to
relevant departments or faculty.  These programs (especially the very big ones)
very rarely need to hire, and just do so when they find someone they like.
Thus, even if their calls are open, it's probably worth applying, because
apparently you never know.

(Digression: Claire actually asked Wes if it was even worth sending
applications to those places given that "it wasn't going to happen."  He
insisted she apply, which is funny in retrospect. She is of the opinion
that her sincere belief that she wouldn't receive an
offer from CMU helped during the interview, because she wasn't especially
nervous or stressed out about messing up.)

It is my *personal opinion* that as a software engineering
researcher, where you apply can matter a great deal.  It is "accepted wisdom" in
the community that SE researchers do not receive invitations to interview for
open job calls that do not mention SE (or possibly PL).  By and large, I
observed this to be true.  All but maybe two of my interviews were at places
that listed SE or PL in their job ads explicitly.  One of the exceptions was
Waterloo, which has a long and storied software engineering tradition (as do
most Canadian institutions).

To generalize, I would encourage you to apply to places that you have
reason to believe are interested in your research area, either based on
word-of-mouth or the job ad copy itself.  Examples: in 2012, NC State had an
established SE faculty leave for another position, while UIUC had an established
SE faculty retire.  Both specifically mentioned SE in their 2013 ads.  I
did apply to a few places with "open calls" based on location (and I would
encourage you to do the same), but it mostly didn't pan out.

One more somewhat editorial note: there's typically a subfield that's "hot" in a
given hiring year, such as big data or health care informatics in 2013.  Please
don't pretend to do these things if you don't.  It's tacky and
obvious.
