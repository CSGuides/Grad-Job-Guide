Michigan), [Claire Le Goues](https://clairelegoues.com/) (Carnegie Mellon), Zak Fry (GrammaTech),
[Kevin Leach](https://kjl.name/) (Vanderbilt University), [Yu Huang](https://yuhuang-lab.github.io/) (Vanderbilt University),

there, but we anticipate this site to be most up-to-date).

# Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community to this guide.  The repository is
[hosted on GitHub]({{site.repo}}). If you have any questions about contributing, please email Madeline Endres at <mendres@umass.edu>.

## Contributing Application Materials

We are always looking for more application material profiles, especially for job-types or job-locations that are currently under-represented in our guide. These materials are hosted on the [Example Materials tab](exampleMaterials.md), and can help students contextualize their application and deal with imposter syndrome. 

If you are interesting in contributing your materials, please fill out our contribution form available [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdLHwzuCsOcKHNBZBO9LGiWhVZPbcIE5-VpQ5hL8wQcFRAAMQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). This form includes places to upload PDFs of your materials, as well as add any information you'd like to better contextualize your application for readers. In this form, you can also indicate if you'd like to be kept anonymous. All materials are optional -- we greatly appreciate anything you'd be willing to share!

## Problems with the Website

Did you notice something wrong with the website (something not working or a
typo)?  Please [create an issue]({{site.repo}}/issues) on our GitHub project.

# Acknowledgments

We would like to acknowledge all of our colleagues who have aided (directly and
indirectly) in the creation of this guide. You may safely assume that all of the

Claire did not consult many people for her contributions to this document, as
she modified it after it had long been written. However, beyond Wes, she would
particularly like to acknowledge the support and assistance of:

- Katie Stolee (Iowa State)
- Yuriy Brun (UMass-Amherst)
- Reid Holmes (Waterloo)
- Ivan Beschastnikh (UBC)
- Stephanie Forrest (UNM)
- John Knight (UVA)

... and the many others who offered advice and support throughout her own job
search.

Zak had a similarly short list of consultations, as he targeted exclusively
industrial research positions and arguably had a more "homogeneous" job search
experience overall:

- Wes Weimer (UVA)
- Lori Pollock (UD)
- Stephanie Forrest (UNM)
- John Knight (UVA)
- Pieter Hooimeijer (Facebook)
