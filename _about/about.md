# Authors

This guide has been written predominantly by Wes Weimer (University of
Michigan), Claire Le Goues (Carnegie Mellon), Zak Fry (GrammaTech),
Kevin Leach (Vanderbilt University), Yu Huang (Vanderbilt University),
and Kevin Angstadt (St. Lawrence University).  Kevin is the primary
maintainer of this version of the guide (there are older versions out
there, but we anticipate this site to be most up-to-date.)

# Acknowledgments

We would like to acknowledge all of our colleagues who have aided (directly and
indirectly) in the creation of this guide. You may safely assume that all of the
good ideas here come from them and that all bad advice comes from us.

Many wise and wonderful people were kind enough to grant Wes the boon of their
wisdom on this subject. They include, but are not limited to:

- Alex Aiken (Stanford)
- Ras Bodik (Berkeley)
- Katherine Compton (Wisconsin)
- Richard Fateman (Berkeley)
- Jill Findeis (PSU)
- Stephen Freund (Williams)
- Patrice Godefroid (Bell Labs)
- Sumit Gulwani (Microsoft)
- Tom Henzinger (EPFL)
- Ranjit Jhala (UCSD)
- Iain Keddie (IBM)
- Jim Larus (Microsoft)
- David Liben-Nowell (Carleton)

Claire did not consult many people for her contributions to this document, as
she modified it after it had long been written. However, beyond Wes, she would
particularly like to acknowledge the support and assistance of:

- Katie Stolee (Iowa State)
- Yuriy Brun (UMass-Amherst)
- Reid Holmes (Waterloo)
- Ivan Beschastnikh (UBC)
- Stephanie Forrest (UNM)
- John Knight (UVA)

... and the many others who offered advice and support throughout her own job
search.

Zak had a similarly short list of consultations, as he targeted exclusively
industrial research positions and arguably had a more "homogeneous" job search
experience overall:

- Wes Weimer (UVA)
- Lori Pollock (UD)
- Stephanie Forrest (UNM)
- John Knight (UVA)
- Pieter Hooimeijer (Facebook)
- Ray Buse (Google)
- Joel Coffman (Johns Hopkins APL)
