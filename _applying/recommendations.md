## Letters of Recommendation

You will need four letters of recommendation, one of which will come from
your advisor. The typical dilemma here involves finding the other three. 
You may well have only published papers with your advisor and the
supervisor from you summer internship. Where do you find two others? 

Start now! Email some of the other professors in your department and make
appointments to talk to them about your research and your plans. Ask them
if they have any ideas, talk about possible collaborations, convince them
to critique drafts of your papers, whatever. The more they know you the
better and you may even get research ideas out of it. 

If you plan to do your job search interviews in the Spring of Year X, talk
to your advisor about who should write your letters in the Summer of Year
X-1 (or earlier!) and then ask them by the end of that summer. Give them
plenty of warning.

At the end of the day, I can only offer myself as a data point for
what was "good enough". I had never written a paper with Alex Aiken but I
had corresponded with him since the end of my undergraduate days. We had
similar research interests, I almost ended up as his advisee, we got along
well at research group lunches, I went to his office more than once to talk
about research and ideas, and he invited me to Stanford to give a practice
talk. I had written a paper with Tom Henzinger, sat in on one of his
classes, and visited his office once or twice to talk about things and ask
for advice. I had never written a paper with Jim Larus but he supervised my
internship at Microsoft Research and was familiar with my research work. 
Left to my own devices, I would have chosen Sriram Rajamani (also from my
internship) instead of Jim since he knew me better personally, but it was
suggested that Jim's more senior position and experience in both industry
and academia would lead to a more useful reference. Talk to your advisors.

Wes's advice about letter writers basically guided my
selection thereof: Wes was my adviser; Stephanie Forrest and I have worked and
written papers together for many years; I have taken classes, written at least
one paper, and supported grants with John Knight throughout my graduate career;
and Mark Harman and I have been in contact about my work since before I received
my Masters.  I was told by at least one department chair that the strength of my
letters was critically important to securing the interview(s) in question.  I
encourage you to select your letter writers carefully.

The jobs I applied for required a maximum of three letters and I was fortunate
enough to get letters from a subset of Claire's letter writers: Wes Weimer
(primary advisor), Stephanie Forrest (mentor and co-author on three papers), and
John Knight (with whom I took a class and often solicited advice from throughout
my grad career).  To highlight a potential pitfall, I will note that one of my
undergraduate advisors (with whom I was co-author on several papers) agreed to
write me a letter of recommendation, but noted that it might be somewhat weak
because of the time that had lapsed since our professional interaction.
Wes's sage advice was that anyone who flat-out admits that they may not be
able to write you the strongest recommendation letter should be used as a last
resort.  While I very much appreciate the generosity and honesty of my previous
advisor, I am glad that I eventually chose someone with a more comprehensive
knowledge of my most recent work.

### Organizing Things for your Letter Writers

The standard practice these days is to make a web page or chart listing all of
the places to which letters must be sent as well as the due dates. 

As of 2013, most schools use some kind of special online web-system for
applications.  If you are like Claire at all, you will be annoyed by the fact
that the systems are all basically the same, and yet you still need to generate
a new account at every one.  A few use [academicjobsonline.com](http://academicjobsonline.com).  These are by far
the easiest positions to apply for.

Regardless of system used, schools typically accept letters of recommendation via
email (i.e., "please submit letters to the following address."; make it easy to
cut and paste the addresses on your web page) but they may issue an email to
your letter-writers instructing them to use an alternative form.  As of 2013, no
positions required letters to be sent physically, and most expressly disallowed
it.  A couple of schools ask for letters only after a first cut of applications,
in which case they will contact your letter-writers directly.

Loosely, your letter-writers will write the letters a day or two before the
first one is due and then send them all out.

It's not perfect and I'm sure you could improve on the format but no
one complained. It should also give you an idea of how the due dates vary
between top-tier teaching-ish schools (e.g., Oberlin at November 19) and
standard research schools (e.g. CMU at January 15).

As an aside, it is *very common* for letters of recommendation to fail to
make it all the way to the people who need to see them.  It is typically very
difficult to distinguish between a world in which your letter-writer did not
submit a letter despite a request from a school; a world in which no such
request was issued; a world in which the letter-writer submitted a letter but
for some reason it was lost; and a world in which letters were all successfully
submitted.  Wes had at least six places email to say only one or two of his
letters got through, and asking to have the others emailed directly to some
address.  Some UC-system schools are infamous for letter mishaps (e.g., losing
more or less every letter from one year's worth of applicants). It is quite
reasonable to send follow-up email to your target departments asking if all of
your letters have made it in to your applicant file (this also shows interest in
the position, but it's unlikely anyone will notice at this stage).
