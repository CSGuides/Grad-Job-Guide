# Cover Letters

Getting a cover letter wrong can have significant consequences. A
poorly crafted cover letter can lead to your entire application being misfiled
or overlooked.

Claie Le Goues, who was Chair of the ISR Tenure Track Hiring Committee at CMU
from 2019 to 2022, has indicated that cover letters are much more important now
than they were in prior decades. She suggests that applicants not treat cover
letters as an afterthought. 

Your cover letter should be brief and to the point. It should: 

1. Quickly introduce who you are (e.g., name, current institution and title).
2. Specify the job you are applying for (including any reference numbers).
3. Give a high-level overview of your research focus.  
4. Indicate why you are excited about the position, why you are a good fit,
  and why you are likely to accept an offer. 
5. Mention any special circumstances (e.g., two-body problem).

Limit the overview of your research focus to a paragraph or two; 
your [research statement](#research-statement) is the place for detail. 
This is particularly important when applying to large schools 
that may have many independent
searches but only one application portal. If you find it difficult to
summarize, Wes recommends prioritizing outcomes (e.g., awards) over
lower-level mechanisms (e.g., mentioning that you use a particular
type of dataflow analysis). **Make it easy for a hiring chair in
your area to quickly realize you're one of theirs!**

(On a related note: if a portal asks you to select research area keywords, please be
accurate. Selecting them all does not help you.)

Reasons you are excited about the position can include the type of
school (public vs. private, R1 vs. liberal arts), the location, 
specific initiatives or centers related to your research, and
past collaborations you've had with faculty at the institution. 
**If someone on the inside told you to apply, be sure to mention it 
in your cover letter.**

Kevin Leach notes that he prepared a generalized cover letter and then changed
sentences to specialize it to each department, such as by listing faculty he knew. Kevin Angstadt
notes that teaching-focused and research-focused positions may merit different cover letter contents.
