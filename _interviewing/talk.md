# Preparing Your Job Talk

Make sure that you schedule a practice job talk of some sort, if only with your
local research group. Everyone else will be able to give you advice on it. Make
sure that people who are not in your field or office come to your practice
talk. During your actual job talks, in general at most one or two other people
will be from your field and the rest of the room will be made up of people from
other domains within computer science.  Besides, the people in your subfield are
probably the reason you're being interviewed; people outside your subfield need
to be convinced.  The exception to this is industry. In large industrial
research labs, for example, you will basically only present to people in your
general area.

The general structure or content of a job talk are
easily available.  We will note that you should definitely include a
future work section.  If you are lucky enough to be at a department that hires
regularly, attend all the talks, even/especially the ones outside your field.
Take notes on how much introductory material, related work, detailed material,
and future work are presented. Then forget about it for nine months until you
have to craft your own.  

Although the average is "fifty minutes for the talk and ten minutes for
questions", different places will have different time requirements. At one stop
Wes was asked to fit the entire thing into 50 minutes. At another he had 75
minutes. Claire found a similar spread.  Prepare your talk in a modular manner
so that you can add or remove sections. Bonus points if you can do
this on the fly -- frequent interruptions are common and can suck up quite a bit
of time.  Try to avoid giving lengthy answers to questions posed in the middle
of your talk (answer the question, but be succinct).  At one venue Wes actually
had audio-visual difficulties (!) delay (and 
thus shrink) his talk for ten minutes.  Claire recommends you travel with your
own laptop and VGA adapter to defend against such hassles.  The exception is the
FFRDCs (like Lincoln Labs), where defense department rules will require you to
email your slides as PDFs ahead of time.

Claire changed her talk modestly between interviews.  Moving things around a bit
between presentations helped keep the talk fresh.  After you've done it a few
times, the jokes become very unfunny to you. Do what you can to avoid boring
yourself.

At some schools, even for a research faculty position, you will be asked to
prepare either a short commentary on your teaching style (in 2013, Iowa State
requested 10 minutes of the job talk be dedicated to teaching), or an actual
teaching demo (Waterloo requested a 20-30 minute example lecture, given
separately from the job talk).  Claire advises you to not skimp on
teaching demo preparation.  It can make a big difference in helping you stand
out from the crowd, the rest of which probably did skimp.

If possible, do a dry run at a school to which you're not applying.  For
example, in September 2012, Claire gave a colloquium talk at Virginia Tech.  It
wasn't nearly so intense as a real interview, and it was nice to practice
the talk with an unfamiliar audience before doing it for real.

There are different opinions on the "one-third one-third one-third"
rule of thumb. A common version suggests that one-third of your talk should
be understood by everyone in the room, one-third should be understood by
people in your general area (e.g., graphics, programming languages,
systems) and one-third should be understood "only by you". 

The trick here is that your job talk must serve many purposes. It must
convince them that you are a good lecturer (i.e., the talk must be engaging
and speak to your teaching abilities). It will also be their first exposure
to your work (as above, many people will be reading you resume at the
beginning of your interview -- unless you're at a small department, don't
expect anyone beyond your host to know anything about you or your work
unless you say it to them) and must help to convince them that your
research has substance. This point is actually somewhat tricky, because if
they asked you for an interview they probably already believe your work is
good enough (based on you resume, letters, and the local evaluation of the
department members closest to your subfield). 

It is the *personal opinion* of both Wes and Claire (thus, no color-coding!)
that basically the entire talk should be understandable to everyone in the room.
Motivation is key. Remind people of why the entire field of programming
languages (or whatnot) is worth considering. A tenured AI professor (as a random
example) may well think that "compilers are a solved problem" and it won't hurt
to remind such a person that there is exciting stuff going on here.  Claire
often used the phrase "This is really exciting because" to help her audience
roadmap key contributions.  Keeping everyone interested will help to convince
them of you teaching potential. In addition, if people cannot understand your
talk they have no way to spot potential collaborations. Our job talks were both
designed to be easily understood by everyone (heavy on motivation, context,
analogies and pictures). We both received many comments from people about just
how understandable they were and we also got quite a few offers for
collaboration based on them (e.g., graphics and database people were able to see
possible fits, not just PL/SE people). Wes specifically asked people after his
talk if the lack of "Greek letters" or "complicated-looking material" hurt his
case. Typical responses included "it wasn't a problem because were able to see
how intelligently you handled yourself when answering the questions" or "it was
fine because we already know how good your work is" or "no, not at all."
However, Claire was advised of the 1/3-1/3-1/3 rule many times throughout her
job search.  Thus we cannot give you a blanket guarantee that following our
approach won't hurt your employability. We were willing to take that risk to
stand up for something we believed in. We encourage you to consider it
carefully.  Finally, the exception here is industrial research (e.g., Microsoft,
IBM): skimp on motivation in such settings -- it will just bore them. It
probably won't count against you (because they explicitly mention that they
realize that no one prepares two job talks and that the intro is appropriate in
academia) but you can possibly earn bonus points by tailoring your talk to those
audiences.
