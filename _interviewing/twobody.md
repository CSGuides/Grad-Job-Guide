## Dual-Career Couples/Divulging Your Partnered Status

Context: Wes was single when he was on the market; Claire had a partner who was
planning to move with her and find a job in the software industry.  Wes
mentioned his relationship status in his cover letters; Claire did not.  The
advice in this section applies to both regular dual-career couples and those
facing the actual academic two-body problem. However, as we are less experienced
with the latter situation, we cannot provide as much insight on the subject.  If
you are in that position, we encourage you to talk to others who have done a
two-body academic search for more concrete and informed advice.

As mentioned above, you may be asked about your marital status during your
interviews.  Claire actually never had anyone ask her this outright. Perhaps
times changed since 2005, or perhaps interviewers are more sensitive about the
issue with a female candidate than they are with a male candidate.  Regardless,
this question is illegal.

*Everyone may ask anyway* (even if you have put the answer
explicitly on the front of your resume). Just deal with it. I have at least two
data points of people being put in very awkward positions here (one was loosely
"we have a lot of great women on campus and if you can't find someone within a
few years there's something wrong with you" and the other was loosely "what's
you religion and sexual orientation?"). Have a nice way to back out of such
conversational cul-de-sacs. If you are asked anything more intrusive than "are
you married?"  feel free to mention it to your host. It's better to point this
out to someone who likes you than to have the evil questioner's possibly
negative opinion of you hurt your chances.

*everyone really wants to know and you should
almost certainly tell them.*  During my interviews, I would
find a way to drop my partner's existence and job ambitions into an early
conversation. *In every case*, I was met with a relieved "Oh I'm so glad
you told me that because we really want to know and we can't ask."  I strongly
encourage you to be open and honest about any two-body or dual-career situation
you may have.  The sooner a department knows about your partner's job needs, the
more likely it is that they can find something for your partner in time to
convince you that accepting the position is beneficial for you and your family.
There is a school of thought that one should wait until one knows a department
is interested before divulging a two-body situation.  However, I have seen this
backfire for other couples more than once, in that by the time an offer is on
the table, it is too late to arrange for an interview with another department.
This is obviously a bigger problem if your partner is also in academia.

I freely admit that I am lucky in that my spouse has made very portable career
choices.  That said, I was extremely upfront about my partner and his job
aspirations, and departments that made me offers simultaneously made connections
for him at local companies.  He even did some onsite interviews during second
visits.

The interview process is a giant two-party courtship exercise in which the
interviewee is trying to convince the department to make a job offer, and the
interviewer is trying to convince the interviewee that the department/location
is the ideal place to live/work.  As such, a legitimate department at which you
want to work should fall over backwards to convince you that they can get your
spouse/partner a job.  Anecdotal example: The dean at UIUC opened his meeting
with me by saying "I am not interested in your family circumstances, and it
would be inappropriate and illegal for me to ask you about them.  However, I
would like to share with you unprompted all of UIUC's policies regarding
dual-career couples..."

Look at it this way: The only reason not to be up front about this issue is that
you are worried that doing so will hurt your job prospects.  However, if a
department (illegally) decides not to hire you because your spouse needs a job,
you probably would not have gone there anyway, because
*your spouse would not have had a job in time for the decision to be
reasonable.* Moreover, and I freely admit that this statement arises from my
privileged position of working in an academic field that is, by and large,
hiring: I personally do not want to work with people who will not hire me
because I am in a romantic partnership or because I have or may one day have
family obligations. If anyone decided not to interview me or offer me a
position for these reasons, they would have saved me the trouble of having to
uncover their misogyny some other way.

On the topic of being honest about things and covering somewhat personal topics,
I feel as though I should mention that coming across like a real person is
helpful in a heavily technical field like ours.  While I may be biased, as I
felt like I came from a somewhat less-strong technical foundation, I found that
people genuinely appreciated me trying to make idle conversation and be
personable.  There are plenty of tips in, for instance, the business world about
being personable, but I think people in all industries look for potential
employees that they think they could work with every day on a personal level.

One final note on partners and jobs: emigrating to Canada with a partner appears
to be pretty trivial, based on Claire's (serious) conversations with Waterloo on
the subject.  The Canadian immigration system is much more straightforward than
the US system (as of July 2013), and their HR departments are practiced in
providing support for the process.
