# Interview Questions

The majority of the interview is made up of one-on-one sessions between you and
an elder researcher you've never met before. Expect the worst-case scenario: you
will have to fill the entire 45 minutes yourself by asking questions. Here are
some questions (and follow-ups) one or both of us asked (and, where applicable,
the canonical cross-institution answer). 

- What's the funding situation like here? Have you had good luck with
  grants recently? When you were a new faculty member did you get much help
  with grant-writing?
- Everyone has only great things to say about this place. What's your
  least favorite part about working here? 
- What can you tell me about the quality of the graduate students here?
  How did you go about picking your first few grad students? I've heard
  rumors that a bad grad student can be a big drain on a new professor -- how
  do you avoid that? 
  - Answer at schools outside the top 10: The average graduate student here isn't as
    good as the average graduate student at Berkeley, so you can't always just take
    one from the pool and be assured of getting a winner. However, the best grad
    students here are just as good as the best ones anywhere else -- it's just that
    the tail of the distribution is longer. 
  - Answer at schools from 5-10: The students here are great, but we lose our
    best candidates to Berkeley/MIT/CMU.
  - Answer at schools in the top 5: The students here are stellar.
- How important is technology transfer or working with the product
  divisions? What's the funding model here? What happens if I pick something
  to work on and no one in development seems to like it? How do I go about
  making contacts with developers? How much academic freedom is there? 
- What's the tenure process like here? Can I suggest my own
  letter-writers? Are there mid-point reviews? Is there a "magic formula"?
  How many people have failed to get tenure in the last 10 to 15 years? 
  
  - Research Answer: There's no magic formula. Teaching, research and
    service are all important. Officially you must be stupendous at two of
    the three and fair at one. However, you can't really pick research (or
    teaching) as the one to be bad at. Teaching can only hurt you -- we will
    look at your numerical teaching evaluations and if they are below a
    cut-off you fail to get tenure. Otherwise we ignore teaching. The amount
    of grant money you bring in may or may not be a tenure consideration. We
    care about paper and venue quality, not quantity. One or two journal
    papers helps. Before going up for tenure you should teach at least one
    undergrad class.
- Friends of mine who are professors at other universities have had to
  hide their teaching awards when they went up for tenure. The subtext was
  that if you had that much time to be spending on teaching you should have
  spent it on research. What are things like here? 
- What's the teaching load? Does it change after you get tenure? Can you
  "buy out" of a class? What does that cost? Who decides what you teach? 
- What's it like being a new single/married faculty member here? How did
  you make friends when you first came to the area? Was it easy to find
  things to do?
- Are the faculty young or old? Is the university structured and
  hierarchical? Do decisions come down from on high? How much power do young
  faculty members have? 
- What's it like to live here? How long is your commute? 
- What's the worst example of office politics you've run into here? What
  do people fight over?
  - Answer: We're very collegial. We don't really have office politics.
    No one gets mad at anyone else. We sometimes squabble over space.
- What's the general view on programming languages (or whatever) here?
Is it a second-class citizen? Is theory emphasized? Practice? Building big
systems? 

Generally, try to have a set of these questions lined up. For two days,
people will repeatedly ask you if you have questions for them.  Claire just
repeated hers when necessary.

Questions they may ask you:
- **Tell me how your interests are aligned with some of the faculty here.
  Who could you work with?**
  - This was by far the most common question. We encourage you to write
    down in some obvious place (e.g., at the top of your notebook) the name
    of anyone you think you could collaborate with so that you can answer
    this question intelligently. 
- **Are you married? Do you have a two-body problem?**
  - See below on the [two-body problem](#dual-career-couplesdivulging-your-partnered-status).
- What will your CAREER award be about? 
- What will your first student's Ph.D. topic be (in general)? How many
  students do you plan to have? 
- What courses would you be willing to teach? Are you interested in
  creating new courses? 
- How will you divide your time between research, teaching and service? 
- What sort of research will you be doing in the future? 
  - This is also a very common question.  Nominally your job talk will have
    addressed this, but they may ask again in a more general sense -- do you think
    you'll be in programming languages (for example) forever, or do you see yourself
    shifting to systems or graphics? Take this opportunity to distance yourself from
    your advisor if need be -- you want to argue that you can pursue your own work
    for tenure. In Claire's experience, the more prestigious the institution, the
    more emphasis they give to this sort of question, sometimes phrased explicitly
    as "What do you envision your tenure case looking like?"
- Where do you get most of your funding? NSF? Other government agencies?
Corporate funding? 

Several of these questions are secretly trying to determine if you have a clue
about how the faculty job works, especially regarding the aspects to which
graduate students are not always exposed.  For example, "have you considered
funding sources for your work?" is mostly an attempt to determine if you have
the remotest idea how the grant system works.  

Wes typically used up almost all of the time asking questions of the other
person. Remember, you are there to interview them as well.  Moreover, apparently
there are candidates who can't keep a conversation going after the first
five minutes, which is the kiss of (awkward) death (Claire heard this from
people interviewing her in several departments).  You would like to
convince the faculty that you are a person they wouldn't mind
working/sharing a hall with.  Being able to hold a reasonable conversation
for 30 minutes is a good start.

Zak would first note that for any type of interview, having looked up the people
on your schedule and noted at least some work they've done recently goes a long
way in the one-on-one interviews.  Many people seemed genuinely surprised when I
brought up a recent paper and had questions and comments about it.
Additionally, I cannot speak to the types of questions asked in academic job
interviews, but I was somewhat surprised at the number and range of technical
questions asked of me during interviews.  Studying up on common interview topics
(theory and algorithms, mostly) will only benefit you in the regard.
