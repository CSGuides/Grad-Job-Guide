# Interview Visits

A typical interview is 1.5 days long, depending largely on the size of the
department (bigger department=more people to meet=longer
interview). You will arrive near dinner time on day X. Someone may or may not
meet you at the airport and may or may not take you to dinner with one or two
others. You sleep and wake up on day X+1, someone may optionally arrive to take
you to breakfast, you head to the venue, and do the interviews. You first
meeting (dinner, breakfast, or interview) is typically with your host. After that it's random. It is completely
legitimate to take notes the entire time (we both did).  This will be 
helpful later when you are trying to recall the conversations you had and the
people you met.  There's a break for lunch at a nice restaurant with two to four
others, then more interviews. This will last until around 5pm, at which point
they'll take you to dinner (unless they did it before, but multiple dinners are
not uncommon) and then you sleep.  For a long interview (e.g., IBM research,
Georgia Tech, UIUC, or large departments in general) things continue the next
morning until lunch. You may optionally arrange for the department to set up a
visit with a real-estate agent for you (if you're staying an extra half-day, for
example). Despite the fact that this seems incredibly presumptuous (since they
haven't hired you yet), it's not insulting or awkward. Even if they don't extend
you an offer, getting a feel for that area will give you a broader basis for
comparison when you are considering your actual offers.  Claire made such
arrangements during her second visits.

Almost all of your time will be spent in offices talking to people
individually. There are really only three main factors that vary between
interview visits. One is the length of each individual interview: anywhere
from 30 minutes to 60 minutes is common. The next is how many individual
interviews you have scheduled. The last is whether your job talk is early
or late. If the talk is later in the day you will have to include a five
minute "elevator" summary of your research at each of your individual
interviews. If the talk is late and the interview slots are thirty minutes,
don't expect to get anything done. If the talk is early you can use that
time to discuss potential collaborations or answer questions they have (and
they will have them!) about your talk. 
 
You will probably have a meeting (or lunch) with the dean (or department
head or upper-level division manager or somesuch). This meeting tends to be
slightly different from all of your other interview chats. At many places
(e.g., Purdue) you will hear about exciting developments and expensive
multi-disciplinary centers being built. Initially this may well sound
irrelevant to you. You should view this sort of thing as a listing of
possible collaborations and sources of funding. You may well receive a copy
of the department's "strategic plan". Other places are of the opinion that
you can either spend your time writing strategic plans or you can spend
your time doing actual work. Ask the dean where the department is going
(invariably the department is growing and going up in the rankings, unless
you're already MIT or McGill, at which point the department is working
hard to maintain its number-one-in-the-country ranking) and what has
changed in the last few years. Ask the dean to forecast things seven years
into the future (you'll have tenure then). Ask the dean about the hiring
plans for the next few years. If all else fails, ask the dean
about the retirement plan (it shows long term interest and you probably
don't know anything about them yet as a grad student). 
Claire met with at least three deans who had reviewed her application and had
questions about her research.  This was more common when the dean was a computer
scientist. Tidbit: as of 2013, the dean at CMU's School of CS still maintains an
active research program (focusing largely on systems).  Their conversation was
quite similar to a standard interview meeting, and Claire has since learned that
the dean in question is absolutely invested in the technical contributions of
anyone to whom the school makes an offer. This was non-typical.

Separate from the dean interview is the interview with the department chair
(or local hiring manager). This is typically the last interview in the
trip. The chair should suggest that they are still in the middle of their
interview process but that they will have completed all of their interviews
and concluded their deliberations in X days. Get this figure as firmly as
you can and write it down. The chair will also want to know what your
time frame for making decisions is (e.g., when will you be done with
your interviews). Ask why they are hiring. Is it to develop courses? Bring
in students? Do more research? Bring in grant money? Grow the department?  Ask
if they expect to continue to hire in the future, and how much they have hired
in the past.

When you are emailing back and forth to set up the interview, arrange for a
meeting with grad students if it is not otherwise on offer (most schools arrange
such a thing by default). This can be over lunch or in some common meeting room
during one of your slots. Be wary of any academic place that won't let you meet alone
with grad students (or undergrads if you're at a college). You'll probably get
at least three or four students at once; Claire had meetings with up to
10-15. The more people in these meetings, the more difficult they can be,
because the candidate has to lead the discussion. 

Sometimes the students will have seen your talk and will have (often very good)
questions.  Claire's toughest grilling during her interviews by far was at the
hands of graduate students.  However, much of the time the students will be
young (first or second year) and often won't really have anything to say.
Occasionally they will ask tough questions like "what will you bring to this
department that we don't already have?" or "how does your research influence
your teaching?" or "what courses will you offer when you first arrive?" or "how
will you choose your grad students?". You should have answers to all of these
anyway -- don't be like Wes and get surprised by them in real-time.

Aside from that, you should take time to ask a bunch of questions, such as about
their research, the program requirements, their background, and so on. Claire
tried to think of issues that mattered to her as a graduate student and ask
about them, such as if they felt the faculty was responsive to their concerns or
how much their input on this particular meeting mattered in the hiring process.
See below for more ideas about what you might ask.


It really doesn't matter what you wear, so wear what makes you the most
comfortable.  No one will remember if you wore coordinated separates
instead of a full suit.  They might remember if you were obviously
uncomfortable in your clothes or if you couldn't walk because of your
shoes.  If you are comfortable in a suit and have one that fits you and you
want to wear it, go ahead.  If you are purchasing your first suit since
high school to interview, abort.  Both Claire and Wes pulled their
interview outfits from their existing wardrobes.  If you do want to wear a
suit of some kind, practice giving talks and sitting around in it before
your interviews.

It is basically impossible to communicate in advance how tiring the
interview process is, especially since interview season is also prime
get-stuck-because-of-snow season. Flying every other day (especially from coast
to coast) is exhausting (East Coasters have a real advantage in terms of jet
lag). Plus you'll lose an hour taking the BART to the airport and then getting
the rental car and whatnot. With time zone shifts you'll never really be able to
get a good meal in transit (except for the ones they take you to) so you'll be
eating too much airport food. Aim for a salad over McDonald's, and pack some
snacks. Beyond that, though, being "on" for a day and a half can be
draining. Aside from these interviews it's rare to spend nine hours (!)
consecutively talking to people about complicated topics, knowing that your
future employment is on the line. You must smile and be friendly and in a good
humor the whole time. It's not difficult but it does take more energy than you
think. Talking to professors you don't know for a nine hours is not like talking
to your friends for nine hours. Consider taking Dramamine or sleeping pills or
somesuch just to ensure that you get some rest on the plane.  Claire always
travels with ear plugs, an eye mask, melatonin, and a kindle/book to help sleep,
as well as a bathing suit and workout clothing to take advantage of hotel gyms
when available.  Take care of yourself physically.  You do yourself no
favors if you are so tired and strung out that your are no longer at your mental
best.

Having applied during COVID-19, all my interviews were fully remote.
Some institutions did one long day of interviews, others spread it over
multiple days.  Given the flexibility, some institutions even did three
or four half-days.  It was also easy enough to not think about wardrobe
(I may have worn sweat pants to more than one tenure-track faculty
interview). 

I suspect things will return to normal post-COVID.
However, my advice is, if you have a remote interview, make sure to have
at least one physical visit at some point.  Since you are making a decision
about a significant portion of your life (tenure-track may potentially
be a lifetime decision), you owe it to yourself to see if you even like
the location.  In addition, set aside time in your interviews to ask
each person about the city, what to do, and what to avoid.  I picked up
tips about traffic (commute time is important to me) and other aspects
of living in the city of each institution.

Whether your interview is in-person or you visit phsyically at some
other time, also take time to learn about things aside from your
institution.  The tired canard "they're not just interviewing you,
you're interviewing them" applies.  It will be an additional burden, but
spend time thinking about whether you would be happy living in that
city.
