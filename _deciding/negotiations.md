# Salary and Startup Negotiations

At some point someone will make you an official offer. This will include
your nine-month salary and a startup package. The startup package should
include money for graduate students (two students for two years each is
typical), travel and equipment. It should also include discretionary funds. 
Your initial contract will probably be for three years, at which point they
will evaluate things and then re-hire you, and then a few years later you
go up for tenure. The year in which one goes up for tenure is fairly
standard, but can vary (e.g., at 5 years in Canada, 9 at CMU, 10 at
Yale/Hopkins, etc.).  Be sure to check, just to be informed. 

Everyone knows everyone else and what the going rate is, so if you don't do
anything about it all of your offers from the same job category will be
quite similar. Thus, haggling. 

The first thing to note is that haggling is controversial and unsettling.
Some people believe that you should just do good work for the good money
they offer you and not become known as one of those grasping department
members who always has to have more than everyone else. In general,
salary negotiations do not take place, because graduate students
have no experience with haggling and find the process uncomfortable.
Talking so bluntly about money and putting yourself forward to get more of
it can be distasteful. Since your new salary will be four or five times
what you are making as a grad student, it may seem like it's not worth
making yourself uncomfortable to get another thousand or two. 

The trick here is that almost all of your raises will be cumulative and
percentage-based. By the laws of compound interest your starting salary
becomes critically important, especially since you're going to be there for
at least twenty years. With one exception, everyone Wes and Claire have talked to was in
favor of haggling for your starting salary. Responses were either "I
didn't do it and now I regret it" or "I did it and it didn't work, but you
should try it" or "I did it and it worked and I'm glad". The common
consensus seems to be that you owe it to your family and future kids and
mortgages to try to get paid what you are worth. 

OK, now that we've decided that selfishness is a virtue (sorry, couldn't
resist), how do we go about haggling? 

The first thing to note is that although you will be conducting this
process with the department chair (or hiring manager or whatnot) who sent
you the official offer, *it doesn't hurt them and they are not really
involved*. If you ask for $5k you're not taking $5k out of the chair's
salary or even the chair's budget. The chair will go to the dean and convey
your request (and typically argue for it). The dean will come back with
something and the chair will relay that you. Do not adopt a zero-sum
mentality here -- you'll hamstring yourself. In industry the situation is
even more clear-cut -- you're not negotiating with your manager, you're
often negotiating with someone in HR or Accounting or somesuch.

This is true for both salary and
startup negotiations.  Negotiating is standard, and they will not think
less of you, unless (I suspect) you're "unreasonable" or rude.  I will
claim that I did my best to be fair and make reasonable requests and to do
so politely.  I have been told that my requests to at least one school were
"all reasonable, professional, and polite." I have also been told that this
is not always the case: "some hires send seven pages of detailed demands."
I don't know what the line is between reasonable and unreasonable, nor if I
succeeded at staying on the correct side of it in all cases, but I
certainly made a good-faith effort.

Anyway, so they've given you an offer with a starting salary of X. How do
you ask more without just saying "give me more money"? There are two
traditional approaches. 

- One approach works by comparison. If you already have a higher offer
  they will probably match it (this isn't a guarantee -- Wes's UMass offer was
  not matched by NYU, for example, and if the schools are far apart in
  rankings they may not play this game). You may well have to send them a
  copy of the other offer to show the dean. This is the easiest approach.
  Basically, you say that you would really like to work here but that you
  have a higher offer from another comparable place. Can they match it?
  They'll get right on it. 
- The other approach is just ask for more money. Mention that you
  think the salary is low or that the cost of living there is high or that
  (you'll never do this, but hey) you're a strong researcher with a
  promising research career coming from Berkeley with a
  better-than-respectable resume and that you think you're worth a bit
  more. 

Evaluate benefits, especially health care, along with salary offers.  One of the
offers Claire received included a fairly high salary compared to her other
offers, but provided notably expensive health insurance that largely
counteracted the salary advantage as compared to other schools (especially given
her chronic medical condition).  You can mention
this type of issue in negotiation conversations.

Regardless, you never want to turn things into an "or-else" or "ultimatum"
situation. Phrasing is key: "your offer is not the most attractive offer
available to me" rather than "give me more or I'm leaving." The fact that
they made you an offer means that they want you. They are sort of on your
side even though they are negotiating. It's also valid to ask to what
extent the salary is negotiable. In many places (e.g., Berkeley, Microsoft)
you obtain permission to hire someone at a certain "level" or "rank" or
"band" and that strictly limits the starting salary range to within two or
three thousand dollars. 

Claire found that there was wide variability in the flexibility that schools had
regarding salaries, especially between state schools.  In her experience,
state and public schools are free and open with the details of their offers
with everyone, because their salaries are typically public knowledge.
Department chairs at private schools often keep those details very close to
the vest.


It may be difficult to adjust your starting salary, but you'll probably find
it easier to change your startup package. You can try to ask for more
students, more discretionary funding, or for the entire startup package to
be discretionary (e.g., "I will be able to live with the amount of money
you're offering me if you allow me to spend it any way I like"). 

This is easier if you can justify your request(s).  For example, Claire blocked
out some travel plans (for some reason, SE conferences in 2013-2015 are all in
far-flung locations, a fact that she mentioned in startup discussions) and
detailed computing equipment.  Ask about department policies on both student
and faculty equipment.  Some departments replace faculty and student computers
every couple of years out of a special fund.  In others, all such replacements
come from faculty budgets.  Ask about the computing facilities and
what kinds of availability guarantees they provide, and whether costs such as IT
support, compute time, or printing are charged to faculty funds.  By the way,
everyone will tell you that they have state-of-the-art computing facilities that
will meet your needs perfectly.  Your goal is to identify exactly what you need
to make sure that it's actually available.  For example, Claire often needs
to execute and manage large numbers of
virtual machines based on a custom image (think Amazon EC2).  Very few
departments can provide this kind of support as of 2013. She planned to purchase
a minimal cloud setup from startup funds and used the specs to support her
requests during startup negotiations.

By some combination of these approaches (considering and comparing across all
offers) Wes was able to increase his (lowest) starting salary by 3.6% and double
his (lowest) startup funds. Claire did not track her "haggling success" in this
way, but she negotiated at least a little bit with every department that
made an offer on both salary and startup, and in all cases was met *at
least* in the middle on at least some portion of her requests.  

You can expect industrial salaries to be 12/9ths of a nine-month academic
salary. However, raises in industry are much more common. For example, a
friend of Wes's has gotten a 10% raise every year for the last five or six
years. Industry raises range between 0% and 15% yearly. You also get
bonuses in industry. 

**Company Trivia**: Friends of Wes's at IBM have suggested that 
you should ask for another $10,000 right off the
bat (and that they'll do it without blinking an eye). If for some
reason you can't bring yourself to do that that it would be "criminal" not
to ask for $5,000. However, multiple data points at Microsoft Research
suggest that it is very difficult to haggle for starting salaries there
because of internal strictures; the same goes for Google. Wes only knows of one success story haggling
at Microsoft, and Claire has never heard of anyone succeed at Google.

Find out when your startup funds expire. In addition, make sure (in writing)
that your grad student funding includes the summer months. A friend of Wes's ended up in
a situation where he "took their word" that it extended to include the summer
and they came back to him later and made a fuss because it wasn't written in the
contract.  This advice ("get it in writing") applies to basically everything,
perhaps especially the teaching leave you can expect as a new hire.
On the subject of Canada: you can definitely negotiate with Canadian schools
just as much (if not more so, in some cases) as you can with US schools.  Note,
however, that offers from Canada are basically incomparable in every way to
offers from the US, because their funding system is completely different, so
comparative negotiation is hard.  Note also that Canadian schools are especially
careful about avoiding salary inversion, but that, like the vast majority of US
state schools, their salary information is public.  Look it up for your
negotiation purposes.

In the interest of full disclosure,
I didn't ask for a higher salary at all schools. Whether I did or not
depended on the offer, especially as compared to my other offers.  I did
negotiate with every department that made me an offer, however, at least on
startup.  Honestly, I found negotiating very difficult.  However, it grew
easier with practice.  The first couple of negotiation emails I wrote took
me hours to compose and send.  By contrast, for my final set of
negotiations, I initiated the conversation on the phone with the department
chair during the "initial offer" conversation.

Finally, if you think you want to haggle but you need more advice about it,
email your local department head (or past department heads). They have
probably seen it many times from both sides of the fence and are often
willing to give advice (it worked for Wes).
