# Dealing With Rejection

After you have had an interview with a place there are basically only two
reasons for them to reject you. 

- One is that they "couldn't build a consensus." Variants on this phrase
  are common. Since you'll be there for a long time (e.g., with tenure) it's
  important that everyone get along. Thus if one or two people argue against
  you, your odds of getting a job there are low. However, since you were
  offered an interview there were at least a few people who liked you, so
  rather than being able to say "everyone hated you" they will say "we
  couldn't form a strong consensus". 
- Another possibility is that you were their second or third choice ("in
  line") and that the first person they offered the job to accepted it. 


You should tread carefully in the time period after your interviews but
before your official offers. Many department chairs have told [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) that they
view it as part of their job (or their responsibility to the department) to 
put the brightest face on this possible and essentially to "string you
along" or "never say no" (and thus keep as many good options for the
department open as possible). Thus a department chair saying "we're still
deliberating" may well mean "we've made a job offer to someone else already
and we're waiting to see how that goes". It has been suggested that
grad students who are naive about the interview process will interpret
"we'll get back to you in a week or two" the wrong way and may thus end up
waiting too long for a job offer that never arrives. In such a case you
should talk to your host or other department members in your area to get 
the inside scoop.

It is my *personal opinion (and experience)* that this isn't really
the case. All of the places that said to me variants of "we're still
interviewing candidates and we'll have our faculty meeting to decide in 2
weeks" ended up making me an offer in 2 weeks -- it wasn't some sort of
smokescreen. Similarly, places that didn't think they were going to be able
to make me an offer (e.g. McGill) told me the rumor early (e.g., "we're
having trouble building consensus, I can't give you any reason to wait for
us") when I asked -- long before they sent an official reject letter. 
This is another case where being more direct or honorable can cost you job offers.
I was willing to deal with people in good faith and assume that they were
not lying to me when they said they would get back to me later. For me it
turned out that they were not lying, but I was willing to take the risk
that they were (and thus that I would wait too long for something that
would never materialize and lose my good offers along the way).  A place
that mentions that they play the "positive spin, never say no" game may
well be dealing intelligently with a harsh economic reality, but you may
not want to work there (cf. office politics).

Similarly, I found that most
schools and chairs were very straightforward with my position on their
"list" and the likelihood of an offer.

I found chairs to be fairly straightforward, especially in light of a
dual-career search.  

While most institutions would notify us together of decisions affecting
the other, I did find that some institutions would
transitively notify one body of another's decision.  That is, I had to hear
from my wife that both our applications were rejected, and vice versa.
