# Introduction

This document summarizes experience, opinions, and advice (and advice received
from others) on looking for jobs in academia and industrial research labs in the
field of computer science. It contains both general advice and information on
three particular job searches: Wes's search for a programming languages / software
engineering position in the Spring of 2005, Claire's search for the same in
Spring of 2013, and Zak's search for industrial research positions in 2014. 
It is structured as a how-to guide for graduate students.
