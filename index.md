title: Computer Science Graduate Job and Interview Guide
nav: Overview
---

# Introduction

This document summarizes experience, opinions, and advice (and advice received
from others) on looking for jobs in academia and industrial research labs in the
field of computer science. It contains both general advice and information on
three particular job searches: Wes's search for a programming languages / software
engineering position in the Spring of 2005, Claire's search for the same in
Spring of 2013, and Zak's search for industrial research positions in 2014. 
It is structured as a how-to guide for graduate students.

# Navigating This Guide

We have divided this guide into the major stages of a job search: finding jobs,
preparing your application, interviewing, and finally deciding between offers.

**This guide isn't just for students on the job market!** Even if you are not
yet on the job market, the portions of this guide focusing on job opportunities
and application preparation can be particularly helpful. Often, your career
goals will inform choices you make during your doctoral studies, and thus being
aware of the kinds of jobs available to you is important.  It can also be
helpful to know what goes into an application package to help you plan ahead.
For example, if you are targeting an academic career that emphasizes
instruction, you might plan for being the primary instructor ("instructor of
record" at some institutions) while still a doctoral candidate. Conversely if
you are most interested in a research-focused career, you might instead choose
to bolster your resume with industrial internships.  It's much better to know 
what to expect and plan ahead than to regret not doing more.

## [Finding Jobs](jobs.md)

As you begin your search, you will first want to think about the types of jobs
that appeal to you.  We discuss various job opportunities in computer science
for students earning doctoral degrees.  Then we give pointers for discovering
open searches and how to read job postings.

## [Preparing Your Application](applying.md)

Applications are reasonably uniform across academic institutions, and my aspects
of an academic application apply to industrial research as well.  In addition
to providing some high-level guidance to get you started with your application
materials, we also provide concrete examples of materials from successful
searches.

## [Interviewing](interviewing.md)

We discuss common activities for interviews and give some hints on questions to
prepare (both to answer and to ask).

## [Making a Decision](deciding.md)

Once you have reached the stage of considering job offers, it's time to decide.
We discuss handling overlapping deadlines and negotiating your salary and
startup. We also offer words of encouragement as you consider which offer to
accept.

## [Example Materials](exampleMaterials.md)

To help you prepare your materials, we have collected the portfolios of successful applicants from past cycles. These include CVs, Cover Letters, Research Statements, Teaching Statements, Diversity Statement, and Application Timelines. Portfolios are searchable by tags (e.g., job type, research area, dual career search, etc.).

# Trivia

- In 2005 Purdue got 380 applicants for 3 job spots in CS and held 14
interviews. In programming languages alone they got 20 applicants and held
6-7 interviews for one spot. In 2005 Virginia got 457 applicants for 4
faculty positions. 
-  Read the <a href="http://www.cra.org/statistics/">CRA Taulbee survey</a>. 
-  Many people will tell you that if all else fails, use rankings to break
ties. Better ranked schools will have better grad students and will find it
easier to get grant money. One problem with this is that different people
remember the rankings differently. Whenever you ask someone for advice, ask
for a relative ranking of your schools. You'll be surprised at how many
complete inversions you receive. 
-  A personal recommendation or inside champion can be a great boost and can
help in case of a tie. If you are trying to end up at school X and you know
someone at Y who is friend with someone at X, having Y them briefly mention
you positively to X won't hurt you. 
- Before the interview you should go over everyone on the faculty web page
and find people with research interests similar to your own. Learn the
names of their projects (at least!). 
- Do not expect to accomplish any work (beyond giving a conference talk)
between February and May. 
- Send thank you emails to everyone, or at least your host, and follow up with
schools in which you're interested, especially if you have deadlines from other
schools.  
- This is easily one of the top three pieces of job search advice Claire was
given: Collude with other people in your field on the market, if you can.
The departments are colluding; you should too.  You can share details about
the offers, which keeps things in perspective.  Also, it's a really long/tiring
process, so it's nice to have someone to commiserate with.  At first you will
resist, mistakenly believing that you are in competition with these people and
that it is weird.  You are wrong.  There are enough jobs to go around.  Make
friends, it's good for you.
- Golden Rule: only drink at interview dinners if your host(s) is/are drinking
(...and you want to, obviously.  Claire is French, and likes wine with dinner). This is
more difficult if you're female because waiters at nice restaurants typically
ask the lady if she wants something to drink first.
- Silver Rule: never say anything mean about anyone, especially not your current
institution or other institutions at which you are interviewing.  This rule
applies even if your current institution is legitimately dysfunctional.
