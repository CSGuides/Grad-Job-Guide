# Introduction

<span class="highlight">*Are you currently in graduate school, and are you considering applying (or currently looking) for a post-graduate position in computer science?*</span> 

**If so, this site is for you!**

This website offers a *summary of experiences, insights, and advice*---both our personal opinions and those from others---*on navigating the job search process for computer science academia and industrial research labs*. It contains both general advice as well as detailed accounts of several specific job searches, including:

* [Wes Weimer's](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/) 2005 search for a position in programming languages or software
engineering, which led to a role at the University of Virginia.
* [Claire Le Goues's](https://clairelegoues.com/) 2013 search for a position in programming languages or software
engineering, which led to a role Carnegie Mellon University.
* Zak Fry's 2014 search for industrial research positions, which led to a role at GrammaTech.
* [Kevin Angstadt's](https://myslu.stlawu.edu/~kangstadt/) 2019 search for a programming languages position, which led to a role at St. Lawrence University.
* [Kevin Leach's](https://kjl.name/) 2020 search for a position in software engineering or security, which led to a role at Vanderbilt University.  
* [Madeline Endres's](https://madelineendres.com) 2024 search for a software engineering position, which led to a role at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

This website is structured as a how-to guide for graduate students.

# Is This Guide For Me?

<span class="highlight">If you are in graduate school and either on the job market or planning to apply for CS-related jobs, this guide is for you.</span>

However, **this guide isn't just for students currently on the job market!** Even if 
you are are just starting graduate school, the sections on [finding job opportunities](jobs.md)
and [application preparation](applying.md) can still be helpful. Your career
goals will often inform the choices you make during your doctoral studies, making it important to
be aware of the kinds of jobs available to you.  

It's also helpful to know what goes into an application package so you can plan ahead.
For example, if you're aiming for an academic career that emphasizes
teaching, you might plan for being a primary instructor ("instructor of
record" at some institutions) while still a doctoral student. Conversely if
you are most interested in a research-focused career, you might instead choose
to bolster your resume with industrial internships.  <span class="highlight">*It's much better to know 
what to expect and plan ahead than to regret not doing more.*</span>

# Navigating This Guide

This guide is organized into the four major stages of a job search:

  1. [Finding jobs](jobs.md)
  2. [Preparing your application](applying.md)
  3. [Interviewing](interviewing.md)
  4. [Deciding between offers](deciding.md) 

This guide also contains 
[<span class="highlight-link">example application materials and interview resources</span>](exampleMaterials.md) 
tailored for different job types including R1 Tenure-Track positions, 
Liberal Arts Tenure-Track Positions, and Industrial Research Positions.

On the rest of this page, we briefly summarize each phase.

## Phase 1: [Finding Jobs](jobs.md)

* <span class="student-q">"What types of jobs exist after CS graduate school?"</span>

* <span class="student-q">"What can I do in graduate school to prepare for the job I want?"</span>

* <span class="student-q">"How can I find jobs to apply to?"</span>

As you begin your search, the first step is to think about the types of jobs
that appeal to you.  We discuss various job opportunities in computer science
for students earning doctoral degrees.  Then we give pointers for discovering
open searches and how to read job postings.

## Phase 2: [Preparing Your Application](applying.md)

* <span class="student-q">"What do I need to apply to CS graduate jobs?"</span>

* <span class="student-q">"How should I write my application materials?"</span>

Applications are reasonably uniform across academic institutions, and many aspects
of an academic application apply to industrial research as well.  We provide 
high-level guidance to help you start crafting your application materials, along with 
concrete examples from successful job searches.

## Phase 3: [Interviewing](interviewing.md)

* <span class="student-q">"When will I hear back from my applications?"</span>

* <span class="student-q">"What does an academic interview look like?"</span>

* <span class="student-q">"How should I structure my job talk?"</span>

We discuss common activities for interviews and give some tips on preparing for 
questions---both those youâ€™ll need to answer and those you might want to ask.

## Phase 4: [Making a Decision](deciding.md)

* <span class="student-q">"Which job should I choose?!"</span>

* <span class="student-q">"How can I negotiate my offer?"</span>

When you reach the stage of considering job offers, it's time to make a decision.
This process can be daunting, and it can be difficult to weigh different factors.
We provide guidance on managing overlapping deadlines and negotiating your salary and
startup. We also offer words of encouragement as you consider which offer to
accept.

# [Examples of Successful Materials](exampleMaterials.md)

We have collected portfolios from successful applicants in past cycles. These include 
CVs, Cover Letters, Research Statements, Teaching Statements, Diversity Statement, Job 
Talk Slides, and Application Timelines. The portfolios are searchable by tags (e.g., 
job type, research area, dual career search, etc.). *These examples offer practical guidance
as you develop your own application.*

<span class="highlight">The job search can definitely be challenging! It can be helpful to 
remember that every successful applicant was once in your position. We hope this Guide 
helps you better navigate each stage of the cycle.</span>



<!-- # Trivia

- In 2005 Purdue got 380 applicants for 3 job spots in CS and held 14
interviews. In programming languages alone they got 20 applicants and held
6-7 interviews for one spot. In 2005 Virginia got 457 applicants for 4
faculty positions. 
-  Read the <a href="http://www.cra.org/statistics/">CRA Taulbee survey</a>. 
-  Many people will tell you that if all else fails, use rankings to break
ties. Better ranked schools will have better grad students and will find it
easier to get grant money. One problem with this is that different people
remember the rankings differently. Whenever you ask someone for advice, ask
for a relative ranking of your schools. You'll be surprised at how many
complete inversions you receive. 
-  A personal recommendation or inside champion can be a great boost and can
help in case of a tie. If you are trying to end up at school X and you know
someone at Y who is friend with someone at X, having Y them briefly mention
you positively to X won't hurt you. 
- Before the interview you should go over everyone on the faculty web page
and find people with research interests similar to your own. Learn the
names of their projects (at least!). 
- Do not expect to accomplish any work (beyond giving a conference talk)
between February and May. 
- Send thank you emails to everyone, or at least your host, and follow up with
schools in which you're interested, especially if you have deadlines from other
schools.  
- This is easily one of the top three pieces of job search advice Claire was
given: Collude with other people in your field on the market, if you can.
The departments are colluding; you should too.  You can share details about
the offers, which keeps things in perspective.  Also, it's a really long/tiring
process, so it's nice to have someone to commiserate with.  At first you will
resist, mistakenly believing that you are in competition with these people and
that it is weird.  You are wrong.  There are enough jobs to go around.  Make
friends, it's good for you.
- Golden Rule: only drink at interview dinners if your host(s) is/are drinking
(...and you want to, obviously.  Claire is French, and likes wine with dinner). This is
more difficult if you're female because waiters at nice restaurants typically
ask the lady if she wants something to drink first.
- Silver Rule: never say anything mean about anyone, especially not your current
institution or other institutions at which you are interviewing.  This rule
applies even if your current institution is legitimately dysfunctional. -->
