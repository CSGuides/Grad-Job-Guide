# Introduction

This document summarizes experience, opinions, and advice (and advice received
from others) on looking for jobs in academia and industrial research labs in the
field of computer science. It contains both general advice and information on
three particular job searches: Wes's search for a programming languages / software
engineering position in the Spring of 2005, Claire's search for the same in
Spring of 2013, and Zak's search for industrial research positions in 2014. 
It is structured as a how-to guide for graduate students.

# Trivia

- In 2005 Purdue got 380 applicants for 3 job spots in CS and held 14
interviews. In programming languages alone they got 20 applicants and held
6-7 interviews for one spot. In 2005 Virginia got 457 applicants for 4
faculty positions. 
-  Read the <a href="http://www.cra.org/statistics/">CRA Taulbee survey</a>. 
-  Many people will tell you that if all else fails, use rankings to break
ties. Better ranked schools will have better grad students and will find it
easier to get grant money. One problem with this is that different people
remember the rankings differently. Whenever you ask someone for advice, ask
for a relative ranking of your schools. You'll be surprised at how many
complete inversions you receive. 
-  A personal recommendation or inside champion can be a great boost and can
help in case of a tie. If you are trying to end up at school X and you know
someone at Y who is friend with someone at X, having Y them briefly mention
you positively to X won't hurt you. 
- Before the interview you should go over everyone on the faculty web page
and find people with research interests similar to your own. Learn the
names of their projects (at least!). 
- Do not expect to accomplish any work (beyond giving a conference talk)
between February and May. 
- Send thank you emails to everyone, or at least your host, and follow up with
schools in which you're interested, especially if you have deadlines from other
schools.  
- This is easily one of the top three pieces of job search advice Claire was
given: Collude with other people in your field on the market, if you can.
The departments are colluding; you should too.  You can share details about
the offers, which keeps things in perspective.  Also, it's a really long/tiring
process, so it's nice to have someone to commiserate with.  At first you will
resist, mistakenly believing that you are in competition with these people and
that it is weird.  You are wrong.  There are enough jobs to go around.  Make
friends, it's good for you.
- Golden Rule: only drink at interview dinners if your host(s) is/are drinking
(...and you want to, obviously.  Claire is French, and likes wine with dinner). This is
more difficult if you're female because waiters at nice restaurants typically
ask the lady if she wants something to drink first.
- Silver Rule: never say anything mean about anyone, especially not your current
institution or other institutions at which you are interviewing.  This rule
applies even if your current institution is legitimately dysfunctional.
